# Engineering-Gold-Crest (November 2019 - April 2020)

The Gold Crest Award is a programme in which students complete an original project, contributing to a field of study within STEM.

Our Task: Designing accommodation for the residents of the Isle of Wight who are suffering from flood-prone zones.

## Goals set:
- Safe, secure and economically viable accommodation
- Allowing for a good quality of life
- Accommodating all of the island's population
- A suitable location
- Present a layout of the entire accommodation


## Our methods:

###### Location:

We took a range of criteria, and justifiably graded them in order of importance (1-5 with 5 being the most important):
Depth to seabed, slope aspect, wind speed, rivers, roads, urban/rural, steepness, flooding, and geology.

With these graded criteria, we used GIS (geographical information system) mapping methodology to accumulate the different layers of data, and stack them on top of each other to analyse the shown results. By overlaying these maps (labelled with the criteria), we could use a score for each coordinate square on the map to figure out the most suitable areas.

As a result, a location was discovered, away from the negative factors (i.e. Flooding and geology), and close to the positive factors (i.e. Roads and urban communities).

###### Accommodation Design:

Our design process started after we chose our location, in order to figure out what conditions we would need to meet, and what areas we would not need to focus on as much.

Due to our location providing very favourable conditions, away from flood risks, we had the opportunity to focus on wider aims like sustainability.

Economically, we wanted to keep it cheaper, so we looked to design something simple, yet still incorporating useful features for sustainability as well as flood protection.

An important consideration was how the residents would received essentials such as electricity, heating and water. Therefore, we implemented features that could make the house self-sustaining:
